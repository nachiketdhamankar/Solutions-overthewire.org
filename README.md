#### Hello!

Welcome to one of my oldest repositories.
This repository was created by a budding software developer in his 2<sup>nd</sup> semester.

I have no idea how, but I discovered this cool game which had puzzles at each level and required some computer science and bash scripting knowledge to solve.

I started this repo to help others who played this game and were stuck at a level. I thought someone would appreciate a reference guide if they were stuck at a level and did not know how to get out of that level. I could only reach the 5<sup>th</sup> level at that time, but I remember enjoying solving the puzzles at each level.

##### Next Steps
I'll be attempting to solve the remaining questions and complete the challenge. To add to the fun, I've added a SSH Wrapper in python. I'll create issues and let others contribute for other languages. With this, I hope I can inspire others to learn more about programming.
